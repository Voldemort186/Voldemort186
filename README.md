- 👋 Hi, I’m @Voldemort186
- 👀 I’m interested in learning hot to hack. My business got hacked and it keeps happening, so i decided to learn for myself how to protect myself and my friends. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Kali Linux. I need all the help I can get. It will be returned in droves. I have specialised skill set that would be handy to most people when a issue strikes. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything I could help with, but at the moment I know nothing. 
- 📫 How to reach me ...via 	jaunc177@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: ...
- ⚡ Fun fact: ...I had no friends at scholl so to pass the time i took over the Novel network, didnt do anything milsious, just sat there with it for a year. It take me three years to learn it though. So rebooting my knowledge from 20 years ago.
